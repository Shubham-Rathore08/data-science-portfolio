# Data Science Portfolio
Repository conataining portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes.

# Projects

## [Project 1: SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction](https://github.com/Shubham-Rathore08/spacex_falcon9_first_stage_landing_prediction))
-	Designed and implemented a machine learning model to predict SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage landing outcomes.
-	Utilized Python, SQL, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, and Plotly Dash for data collection, cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization.
-	Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and built predictive models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM.
-	Achieved 83% model accuracy on test data and provided data-driven insights into key factors influencing landing success.
-	Developed interactive dashboards and geospatial visualizations to display launch site performance and success rates.

## [Project 2: Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study]
-		Analyzed 12 months of bike-share usage data to identify behavioral trends between casual riders and annual members.
-	Cleaned and prepared large datasets using R and Excel, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.
-	Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover user patterns and usage frequency across different demographics and seasons.
-	Developed visual dashboards and charts in Tableau to support strategic recommendations aimed at converting casual riders to annual members.

## [Project 3: Tesla_GameStop_Stock_Analysis](https://github.com/Shubham-Rathore08/Tesla_GameStop_Stock_Analysis)
